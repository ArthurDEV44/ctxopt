# Claude Code Integration

This guide walks you through setting up Distill with Claude Code.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed ([download](https://claude.ai/code))
- Node.js 18+ installed

## Quick Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install -g distill-mcp
distill-mcp setup --claude
```

Done! Restart Claude Code and you're ready.

## Manual Setup

If the automatic setup didn't work, configure manually:

Edit `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "distill": {
      "command": "distill-mcp",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with npx (no global install):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "distill": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["distill-mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify Installation

Restart Claude Code, then ask:

```
Run the session_stats tool
```

You should see session statistics with tokens used and saved.

## Using Distill Tools

### Smart File Reading

Instead of reading entire files, use smart_file_read:

```
Use smart_file_read to get the structure of src/server.ts
```

### Compressing Build Output

When you get build errors:

```
Use auto_optimize to compress this build output: [paste output]
```

### Session Statistics

Check your savings:

```
Show my session stats with detailed breakdown
```

## Recommended CLAUDE.md Setup

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to enforce Distill usage:

```markdown
## MCP Tool Usage

When reading source code files for exploration, use:
- `smart_file_read` instead of `Read` for .ts/.js/.py files

When you see large command output (>500 chars):
- Use `auto_optimize` to compress it
```

## Installing Project Hooks

Distill can install hooks that remind you to use optimization tools:

```bash
distill-mcp setup --hooks
```

This adds hooks to your project that:
- Suggest `smart_file_read` when reading code files
- Suggest `auto_optimize` for large bash outputs
- Remind about MCP tools on each prompt

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Starting

1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (needs 18+)
2. Run doctor: `distill-mcp doctor`
3. Check logs in Claude Code's output panel

### Tools Not Appearing

1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Verify `mcp.json` syntax is valid JSON
3. Try running `npx distill-mcp serve` manually to check for errors

### Permission Issues

On macOS/Linux, you may need to make the command executable:

```bash
chmod +x $(which distill-mcp)
```
